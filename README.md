Selenium Testing with JUnit 

This repository contains Selenium test scripts implemented with JUnit for automated web testing. These tests are designed to validate the functionality of web applications across different browsers and environments.
Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven
- Selenium WebDriver
- JUnit

*To create a Maven project on GitHub that executes with the command mvn verify, you can follow these steps:

1.Create a Maven Project:
  Start by creating a new Maven project locally on your computer. You can do this by using the following Maven command in your   terminal:

  mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=my-project -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -  DinteractiveMode=false

  This command creates a basic Maven project structure with the group ID com.example and artifact ID my-project. Adjust these   values according to your project.

2.Initialize Git Repository:
  Navigate to your project directory and initialize a Git repository:

  cd my-project
  git init
  Create a GitHub Repository:

3.Go to GitHub and create a new repository with the same name as your local project (my-project). Follow the instructions provided by GitHub to create the repository.

4.Set Remote Origin:
  Once your GitHub repository is created, add it as the remote origin for your local Git repository:

  git remote add origin <repository-url>

  Replace <repository-url> with the URL of your GitHub repository.

5.Commit and Push Your Project to GitHub:
  Add and commit your project files to Git, and then push them to your GitHub repository:

  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  git push -u origin master

6.Add Maven Configuration:
  Make sure your Maven project includes a pom.xml file with appropriate configurations, including dependencies and plugins   needed for your project. Ensure that you have the necessary plugins configured to run your tests during the verify phase.

7.Write Tests:
  Write your Selenium tests within your Maven project. You can organize them in the src/test/java directory according to the   package structure you prefer.

8.Add mvn verify Command to README.md:
  In your GitHub repository, update the README.md file to include instructions on how to execute the tests using the mvn   verify command. You can provide a brief overview of your project and include any additional setup instructions if necessary.

9.Commit and Push Changes:
  After updating the README.md file, commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository:

  git add README.md
  git commit -m "Add instructions for executing tests with mvn verify"
  git push

Now your Maven project is hosted on GitHub, and others can execute your tests using the mvn verify command by following the instructions in the README.md file.
